# TODOs
A list of potential ideas and tasks that needs to be done. Not in prioritized order.

- [ ] Have some free trial feature for a subscription
  - Sometimes we have free trials that will expire after a certain amount of time and then start charging us. We should be notified before that, and also understand what the price should be once it rolls over to a normal sub.
  - This also should work with limited time offers where you get lower price for a few months before going back to normal prices.
- [ ]  For the Service Cancellation guides it is probably good to support multiple languages, and regions for the guides. As how you cancel might differ from different regions.
