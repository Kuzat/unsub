# TODOs
A list of potential ideas and tasks that needs to be done. Not in prioritized order.

- [ ] Have some free trial feature for a subscription
  - Sometimes we have free trials that will expire after a certain amount of time and then start charging us. We should be notified before that, and also understand what the price should be once it rolls over to a normal sub.
  - This also should work with limited time offers where you get lower price for a few months before going back to normal prices.
- [ ]  For the Service Cancellation guides it is probably good to support multiple languages, and regions for the guides. As how you cancel might differ from different regions.
- [ ] Add all the currencies
- [ ] Admin feature, such as being able to edit all services and create new global services.
- [ ] The merge services page to help find duplicate services and merge them into new global services
- [ ] Add pagination UI and search fields to Services, and Subscription page
